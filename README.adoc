# Microstream integration with Jakarta Data and NoSQL
:toc: auto

## Introduction

Microstream Integration aims to explore the capability of Jakarta persistence specifications to make your life as a Java developer easier.

* *Jakarta Data*â€™s goal is to provide a familiar and consistent, Jakarta-based programming model for data access while still retaining the particular traits of the underlying data store.
* *Jakarta NoSQL* is a Java framework that streamlines the integration of Java applications with NoSQL databases.

## Goals

* Increase productivity performing common Microstream operations
* Rich Object Mapping integrated
* Java-based Query and Fluent-API
* Explore repository capability

## Jakarta NoSQL

For mapping both Data and NoSQL specifications, you should use Jakarta NoSQL. https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql[Check the NoSQL for more information].

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Book {


    @Id
    private String isbn;
    @Column
    private String title;

    @Column
    private Integer edition;

    @Column
    private Year release;

    @Column
    private String author;

    @Column
    private boolean active;
...
}
----

After mapping an entity, you can explore the advantage of using a `Template` interface, which can increase productivity on NoSQL operations.

[source, java]
----
@Inject
Template template;
...
Book effectiveJava = new Book();
template.insert(effectiveJava);

List<Book> result = template.select(Book.class).where("title").eq("Effective Java").result();

template.delete(Book.class).where("edition").lte(2).execute();
